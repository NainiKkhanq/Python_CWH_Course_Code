s = {12,12,4,1} # this is the way to Write Set
s  =() # This is a empty set but in order to add values in it you need to use  {} brackets

v ={12,5,5,5,5,}# This set contains repeated values (5 written 4 time) but Set will save 5 only one time

print(v) # THis will only show 12,5 (5 will be printed only one time so in set values can't be repeated)
